To be able to run the Zoiper Swift Example, you will need to include the zdk.objc.framework to the project and then to build it. 
By default zdk.objc.framework is not included in the example. 
If you still don't have the framework, please contact us on zoiper.com.

zdk.objc.framework MUST be placed in current folder!
